# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem Definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics.

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

Design statement: I will to design and make a digital ledger for a client who is a local trader. The digital ledger will provide cryptocurrency tracking, which includes tracking of transactions and statistics regarding the selected cryptocurrency, IOTA, and is constructed using the software PyCharm. It will take two weeks to make and will be evaluated according to these six criterias. 

IOTA is a cryptocurrency that strives to eradicate the limitations that blockchains have on the world of crypto. Blockchains are a way that data about crypto transactions can be stored, but has a multitude of downfalls, like it's lack of privacy and potential costliness. In order to combat this issue, IOTA operates on a network called the Internet of Things which claims to allow for feeless and safe transactions.
