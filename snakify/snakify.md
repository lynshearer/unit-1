07: Reverse three digits

Given a three-digit integer number, print its digits in a reversed order.

12: Car route

A car can cover distance of N kilometers per day. How many days will it take to cover a route of length M kilometers? The program gets two numbers: N and M.

![](snakify2.12.png)

13: Day of week

Let's count the days of the week as follows: 0 - Sunday, 1 - Monday, 2 - Tuesday, ..., 6 - Saturday. Given an integer K in the range 1 to 365, find the number of the day of the week for the K-th day of the year provided that this year's January 1 is Thursday.

14: Digital clock

Given the integer N - the number of minutes that is passed since midnight - how many hours and minutes are displayed on the 24h digital clock?
The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 59).

For example, if N = 150, then 150 minutes have passed since midnight - i.e. now is 2:30 am. So the program should print 2 30.

15: Total cost

A cupcake costs A dollars and B cents. Determine, how many dollars and cents should one pay for N cupcakes. A program gets three numbers: A, B, N. It should print two numbers: total cost in dollars and cents.

![](snakify2.15.png)

16: Century

Given a year as a positive integer, print its century. Mind that the 20th century began on 1901 and ended on 2000.

17: Snail

A snail goes up A feet during the day and falls B feet at night. How long does it take him to go up H feet?
Given three integer numbers H, A and B (A > B), the program should output a number of days.

![](snakify2.17.png)

18: Clock face - 1

H hours, M minutes and S seconds are passed since the midnight (0 ≤ H < 12, 0 ≤ M < 60, 0 ≤ S < 60). Determine the angle (in degrees) of the hour hand on the clock face right now.

![](snakify2.18.png)

19: Clock face - 2

Hour hand turned by α degrees since the midnight. Determine the angle by which minute hand turned since the start of the current hour. Input and output in this problems are floating-point numbers.
