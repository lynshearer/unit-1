According to a 2016 brain capacity study performed by the Salk Institute (founded by doctor and scientist Jonas Salk), the adult brain capacity for memories could be in the petabyte range. A petabyte includes 1000000 gigabytes. So the adult brain has a memory capacity of anywhere upwards of 1000000 gigabytes. This divided into 4 GB USB's would mean that the adult brain memory capacity would require anywhere upwards of 250000 USB's to store.
